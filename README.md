This is my ender 5 settings, using Marlin `bugfix-2.0.x`.

I have a Creality 4.2.7 board, and I think I have the upgrade 800 steps/mm z-axis leadscrew (it doesn't fall down when power is cut).

I've used the STMF103RE_creality (512K) architecture to build.

Some of the settings (e.g. setting the 800 steps/mm, and the probe offsets) don't seem to have been recognized by the printer, so I just put them in manually via the LCD screen on the printer.
